* kernel 2.4 support with a custom transparent proxy patch
  (available at http://www.balabit.hu/en/downloads/tproxy)
* transition to glib 2.0 instead of 1.3.1
* transition to python 2.1

* rewritten, more robust UDP implementation
  * the same proxy can work on UDP and TCP transparently without changes 
    (for example: plug)
  * it is theoretically possible to convert an UDP stream to a TCP stream on
    the fly, without the proxy knowing this fact
* the introduction of fastpath connection establishment
  * proxies can register the connections they are interested in, and as a
    new connection arrives a callback is delivered (dispatch)
  * the possibility to support several subsessions in a single proxy
    instance (plug is currently the only one which supports this, see the
    documentation of the attributes secondary_mask & secondary_sessions)
  * it is now much easier to support protocols with multiple channels (e.g.
    FTP)
* an effort was made to make log messages more consistent, log categories
  better selected
* updated authentication framework, the possibility to use ZAS2 and Satyr2
