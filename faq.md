What is *Zorp GPL*?

: *Zorp GPL* is a next generation, open source proxy firewall with deep
protocol analysis. It allows you to inspect, control, and modify traffic
on the application layer of the ISO/OSI model. Decisions can be made
based on data extracted from the application-level traffic (for example,
HTTP) and applied to a certain traffic type such as users or client
machines. It ensures that the traffic complies with the particular
protocol standards, and allows you to perform specific actions with the
traffic.
